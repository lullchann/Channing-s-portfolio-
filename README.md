    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Channing Williams, a student athlete, web designer, and someone who’s always thinking about how to uplift others—on and off the court.  
      I spend my early mornings grinding on the basketball court, and my afternoons designing clean, creative websites. My passion for service is just as strong as my passion for design—I love giving back through community work, mentorship, and helping others bring their ideas to life through design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I’m leading a team project or running drills at practice, I bring energy, commitment, and creativity to everything I do. I believe websites should not just work—they should inspire. Let me show you how I bring that energy to design.

    <h2>Service & Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of design and athletics, I’m passionate about making an impact in my community. I’ve volunteered for local youth programs, helped organize charity drives, and participated in clean-up efforts around the city. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe leadership doesn’t stop at the scoreboard or the screen—it’s about showing up for others and helping your community grow.
